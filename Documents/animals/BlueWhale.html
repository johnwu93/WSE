The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a 
<A href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammal</A> belonging to the 
baleen 
<A href="Whale.html">whales</A> (Mysticeti). 
At 30 metres (98 ft) in length and 
up to 170 tonnes (190 short tons) in weight, it is the largest 
extant animal and is the heaviest known to have existed.

Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of 
bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at 
least three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North 
<A href="Atlantic.html">Atlantic</A> and 
North 
<A href="Pacific.html">Pacific,</A> B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda 
(also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South 
Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another 
subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost 
exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.
